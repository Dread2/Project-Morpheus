# Project-Morpheus
Project Morpheus is an open-source platform designed to analyze ResMed CPAP, BiPAP, and ASV device data to optimize pressure settings for UARS flow limitations &amp; RERAs. Using ML and signal processing techniques, it identifies RERAs and subtle breathing patterns to provide recommendations for optimized pressure.
