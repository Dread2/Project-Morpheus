# Project-Morpheus
Project Morpheus is an open-source platform designed to analyze ResMed CPAP, BiPAP, and ASV device data to estimate pressure settings for UARS flow limitations and RERAs. Using ML and signal processing techniques, it identifies RERAs and subtle breathing patterns to provide recommendations for estimated EPAP / IPAP pressure.
